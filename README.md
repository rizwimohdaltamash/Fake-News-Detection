# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake News Detector  

This project is a **Streamlit-based application** that classifies news articles as either **Fake** or **Real** using a trained **LSTM model**.  
The app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for evaluating the authenticity of news content.

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Interactive Interface:** Paste any news content and get a prediction instantly.  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Powered by an LSTM model for accurate classification.  
- **Custom Styling:** Enhanced visuals for an intuitive user experience.  
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Quickly determine if news is fake or real.

📊 Dataset

The app uses a labeled dataset containing two categories of news articles:

True.csv: Real news articles

Fake.csv: Fake news articles

Both datasets are combined for model training and evaluation.
